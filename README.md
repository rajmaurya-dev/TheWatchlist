# Viewers - Share What You're Watching

Viewers is a social platform that allows users to create watchlists of their favorite movies and TV shows and see what their friends are watching to get recommendations.

## About

The goal of Viewers is to connect friends and enable discovery of new movies and shows based on the tastes of people you follow.

Key features include:

- Create custom watchlists by title, genre, streaming service, etc
- Follow friends and see additions to their watchlists in realtime
- Get recommendations of new shows and movies based on watchlists from friends
- Share watchlists on other social platforms

Viewers recommends content based on the collective watchlist data from everyone in your network. The more active viewers you follow, the better recommendations you will get!
